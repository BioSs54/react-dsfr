# ðŸ“Š Analytics

In the realm of analytics, the Service d'Information du Gouvernement (SIG) stipulates the utilization of [Eulerian](https://www.eulerian.com/). The vanilla JS/CSS module @gouvfr/dsfr, which powers this toolkit, is deeply integrated with the Eulerian platform.

Activating it equips you with the capabilities to accurately track user interactions with your application, including specific buttons they click and pages they navigate. To comply with GDPR regulations, it's crucial to request user consent before implementing this detailed level of tracking.

Presented here is an illustrative example demonstrating how to initialize the Eulerian integration and solicit user consent for its usage.

To operate effectively, Eulerian requires certain parameters, which are provided upon initial registration on the Eulerian platform. This example includes only those. For a complete list and descriptions of accepted parameters, refer to the following link:

For efficient tracking of interactions with various website elements, it's essential that each DSFR component is assigned a unique ID. This allows you to distinguish between different elements via the Eulerian dashboard metrics.

Each component of the react-dsfr toolkit can be explicitly given an ID prop. In the event you don't assign one, react-dsfr will make an effort to generate comprehensible IDs that aid in component identification.
